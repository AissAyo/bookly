                           <p>The fourth book in the 'European Public Investment Outlook' series focuses on the urgent issue of how to finance needed investment in critical tangible and intangible infrastructure given high levels of public debt, a thorny problem facing many governments across Europe. Drawing on expertise from academics, researchers at public policy institutes and international governance bodies, the contributors analyse the current situation and prospects and propose feasible solutions.
                             Financing Investment in Times of High Public Debt offers a powerful combination of high-level analysis of cross-continental policies and trends, with close examination of specific contexts in France, Italy, Germany and Spain. The chapters in Part II explore challenges including how to finance climate investments, the extent to which national promotional banks can offer solutions, EU budget reform and recent trends in tax progressivity.
                             This book is essential reading for economists, policymakers, and anyone interested in implementing and financing public policy in Europe and wanting to better understand the intricacies of EU governance and institutions.</p>

                           <h3>Managing Cloud Native Data on Kubernetes</h3>
                           <p>Is Kubernetes ready for stateful workloads? This open source system has become the primary platform for deploying and managing cloud native applications. But because it was originally designed for stateless workloads, working with data on Kubernetes has been challenging. If you want to avoid the inefficiencies and duplicative costs of having separate infrastructure for applications and data, this practical guide can help.

Using Kubernetes as your platform, you'll learn open source technologies that are designed and built for the cloud. Authors Jeff Carpenter and Patrick McFadin provide case studies to help you explore new use cases and avoid the pitfalls others have faced. You'll get an insider's view of what's coming from innovators who are creating next-generation architectures and infrastructure.

- Learn how to use basic Kubernetes resources to compose data infrastructure
- Automate the deployment and operations of data infrastructure on Kubernetes using tools like Helm and operators
- Evaluate and select data infrastructure technologies for use in your applications
- Integrate data infrastructure technologies into your overall stack
- Explore emerging technologies that will enhance your Kubernetes-based applications in the future

                           <p>Svelte departs from the virtual DOM approach by compiling the code you write into native-browser JavaScript when you build your application. 
                           The result is minimal and highly optimized pure JavaScript that the browser executes with no heavy runtime. In Svelte Succinctly, Ed Freitas will 
                           show readers how to install Svelte and give them a condensed overview of how to build an app with Svelte using SvelteKit.
